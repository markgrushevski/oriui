# Contributing

How work flows through oriUI — branches, commits, versioning, and releases. The _why_ behind
these choices lives in [DECISIONS.md](DECISIONS.md); the coding conventions and commands in
[CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md); the npm publish mechanics in [RELEASING.md](RELEASING.md).

Prerequisites: **Node ≥ 20.19** (the Vite 8 floor) and npm. The repo uses **npm workspaces** —
a single root `npm install` wires the `docs/` and `packages/*` workspaces.

## Branching

`main` is an **always-green trunk** — every commit on it is releasable, and the docs site
deploys from it. So `main` advances whenever a coherent unit of work is done, **not only at
releases** (a release is a separate, tagged event — see below).

- Branch off `main` per unit of work, with a type-prefixed name that matches the commit it will
  carry: `feat/…`, `fix/…`, `docs/…`, `refactor/…`, `build/…`, `chore/…`.
- Keep branches **short-lived** and focused. (`refactor/oriui-foundation` was a one-off
  foundation epic; day-to-day work should be much smaller.)
- Integrate with a **`--no-ff` merge** so `main`'s first-parent history records each branch as a
  single merge commit — then delete the branch. Prefer a merge commit over a fast-forward.
- **The deciding factor is commit count, not size.** Anything that lands as **one commit** — even a
  big self-contained feature (a new package, a broad rename) — goes **straight to `main`**: commit there
  once the gates are green (no branch, no merge bubble). Create a branch + `--no-ff` merge **only when
  the work is several commits** to group under one merge, or it genuinely needs PR review / CI isolation
  before landing.

```bash
git switch -c feat/my-thing main
# … commits …
git switch main && git merge --no-ff feat/my-thing
git push origin main && git branch -d feat/my-thing
```

## Commits

[Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org). See **CLAUDE.md › Commits** for the
full rules: types (`feat` / `fix` / `refactor` / `build` / `docs` / `chore` …), `!` for breaking,
author **Leonid**, **no `Co-Authored-By` trailer**, and grouping into reasonably-sized commits.

A husky **pre-commit** hook runs `npm run build` + `lint-staged` on every commit, so a commit
fails fast if the build or formatting breaks. CI (GitHub Actions) re-runs the gate on every push
to `main` and every PR: `lint:ci → types → test → build` across Node 20.19 and 22.

## Versioning

oriUI follows **SemVer**. The line is currently **`1.0.0-alpha.0`** — alpha, so the public API
may shift before `1.0`.

The three published packages move in **lockstep**: `@oriui/vue`, `@oriui/headless`, and `@oriui/css`
always share one version, and their internal dependencies are pinned to that exact
version (a
`*` range cannot match a prerelease — see [RELEASING.md](RELEASING.md)). Prereleases publish
under the **`next`** npm dist-tag, so a plain `npm install @oriui/vue` does not pick up an alpha.

## Releases & tags

A **release is a deliberate event, separate from merging to `main`** — and it is automated with
**[changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets)** (alpha pre mode). The flow:

1. **Add a changeset** with your change, before merging the PR: `npm run changeset` — pick the bump
   type and write the changelog line. The three packages are a **fixed** group, so naming any one
   bumps all three; commit the generated `.changeset/*.md`.
2. **Merge to `main`.** The **Release** workflow (`changesets/action`) opens/updates a **"Version
   Packages"** PR that applies the pending changesets — bumping the lockstep version + the pinned
   internal deps and updating each `CHANGELOG.md`.
3. **Merge the "Version Packages" PR.** That publishes the bumped packages to the **`next`** dist-tag
   (via OIDC Trusted Publishing — no token, provenance attached) and tags the release commit, so every `@oriui/vue@x` is
   checkout-able.

Full runbook — token setup, the manual fallback (`npm run version` / `npm run release`), and the
prerelease / dist-tag rules — is in [RELEASING.md](RELEASING.md).
